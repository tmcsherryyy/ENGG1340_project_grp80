Project Ideas:
Table management system

Good restaurants usually run a system to manage the occupancy, reservation, and billing of their tables. In this idea, we are going to build a small table managemnet system to manage few tables of different sizes in a hot-pot restaurant. The default setting of this restaurant,
4 tables of 2
4 tables of 4
2 tables of 6
2 tables of 8
1 table of 12
$180 per head
10% service charge is needed
time allowed per table is 2.5 hours
food and drinks are self-served and free of charge

The system shall include basic features of a table managment system,
1. availability of a table
2. occupy a table
3. release a table
4. suggest the most suitable table according to the given number of customers
5. time of occupying a table
6. notification for waiters of table occupied for more than 2.5 hours
7. allow changes of price, table number and size of tables
8. able to print the order list of a table for checking and billing
